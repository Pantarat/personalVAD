"""@package generate_overlapping_utterances

Author: Enhanced by AI Assistant
Based on: concatenate_utterances.py by Simon Sedlacek

This module generates overlapping utterances from the LibriSpeech dataset.
It allows configurable overlap percentage and amplitude levels for overlapped segments.

Key Features:
- Configurable overlap percentage (0-100%)
- Adjustable amplitude ratio for overlapped utterances
- Proper label generation: TSS when target speaker is present, NTSS otherwise
- Compatible with existing augmentation pipeline
